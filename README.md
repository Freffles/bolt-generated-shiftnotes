# bolt-generated-shiftnotes
This was originally created with bolt.new-any-llm as a test
Then it was git cloned to a local folder to see if Windsurf could do anything with it.
There was a bit of fussing around but I got it working. This was easier than another app that actually had a backend. Windsurf did not like that. Simple project structure might also be a factor.
